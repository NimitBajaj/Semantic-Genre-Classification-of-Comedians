# 🎭 Semantic Genre Classification of Comedians

### 🧠 Domain: Data Science | 🐍 Tools: Python, NLP, NLTK, Semantic Analysis

---

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **classifying stand-up comedians based on their humor genre** — such as *satirical*, *observational*, *dark*, or *absurdist humor* — using **semantic and linguistic analysis** of their performance transcripts.  
By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system identifies tone, theme, and semantic patterns unique to each comedian’s style.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Semantic Genre Classification:**  
  Categorizes comedians into humor types like satire, observational, and more.
  
- **NLP-Based Analysis:**  
  Utilizes **NLTK** and **WordNet** to perform semantic and tone extraction.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Represents humor genre distribution through **word clouds** and **frequency-based plots**.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Stand-up transcripts sourced and cleaned for analysis.

2. **Text Preprocessing:**  
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization  
   - POS tagging and semantic relationship extraction using WordNet

3. **Semantic Analysis:**  
   Detection of humor-related patterns, tones, and topic clusters.

4. **Genre Classification:**  
   Categorization into humor genres using semantic similarity and keyword frequency.

5. **Visualization:**  
   Word clouds and bar plots to illustrate key themes and word distributions.
