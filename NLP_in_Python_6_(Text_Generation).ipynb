bigass b surely more letters will fit   same spaceyoure very friendly here  chicago i mean were all violent here but youre very friendly no really  i dont like confrontation cause ive never been   fight before though maybe you could tell that from  first moment i walked out on stage i dont give off that vibe some people give off  vibe  right away theyre like do not fuck with me my vibe  more like hey you could pour soup  my lap  ill probably apologize  you when i walk for real my feet go out like this im so open  vulnerable i look like  doll that you point out molestation on show us on this white comedian where  man touched youits been  while since ive been home  chicago i got married since then  i married my wife i love saying my wife it sounds so adult thats my wife its great you sound like  person i said it even before we were married we were just dating  we were once getting on an airplane  annas ticket didnt say anything  my ticket said priority access it doesnt matter why but we were getting on  i said uh can my wife board with me  they were like yes  course right this way  i was like oh that  so much better than all those times i was like can my girlfriend come  yeah i shouldnt have said it that way but still my wife just has some kickass  it you know get away from my wife no one talk  my wife marriage  gonna be very magical i didnt kill my wife thats like ooh whos that fella i bet he did kill his wife being married  so nice i never knew relationships were supposed  make you feel better about yourself thats not really  joke thats just  little sweet thing i like  say cause id been  relationships where i got cheated on like long ones i dont know if youve ever been   long relationship where you got cheated on but it changes your whole worldview cause when i was  kid i used  watch americas most wanted you know how kids do  i would always think  myself how could another person kill someone how could  human being kill another human being  then i got cheated on  i was like oh okay im not gonna do it but i totally get it  i dont mean  that way  like no one else can have you i dont care about that its just creepy  have an ex out there after things have ended badly they have  lot  information anyone whos seen my dick  met my parents needs  die i cant have them roaming aroundi talked   lot  people before i got engaged you know  i heard this expression about whether or not you should get married this  an old expression people say this they say why buy  cow when you can get  milk for free you ever heard that before its  bananas insulting expression  an entire gender but also it makes no sense why buy  cow when you can get  milk for free youre not allowed  milk  cow that you dont own thats not even  situation was that  problem at one point like   dairy community was that happening  hundred years ago  some village some dutch prick was sneaking  at night being like ahhaha i take your milk   farmer was like well then this  your cow now  he was like no no proof  purchase  he ran off into  night that sounded dutch right you know what that you know what that expression means it means why would you marry  woman if shes already having sex with you which has nothing  do with what relationships are even like anymore now its like why buy  cow uh maybe because every day  cow asks you when youre gonna buy it   you live   really small apartment with  cow so you cant avoid that question at all  also  cow  way better at arguing than you are   cow grew up   family that knows how  argue why buy  cow uh maybe because every time another cow gets bought you have  go   sale  you have  sit next  your cow at  sale  your cow looks over at you  entire time like  does not enjoy  sale at all even though shes  one that wanted  go   sale  shes especially mad because that farmer  cow met like eight months after you guys met why buy  cow well lets be real here youre very lucky  have  cow that you do have roping  cows  getting milk out  them was never anything you were known for john by  most liberal  estimates there have been about eight cows total several unmilked   lot  people think that you like bulls  if you just bought they assume it when you search your name  third thing  come up  like john mulaney bull  if you just bought  cow nobody would say that anymore theyll still say it cause there are those guys who they buy  cow  then on  side total matador but but for real chicago why buy  cow lets be real why buy  cow because you love her you really do  yeah yeah sure shes  bossy little jew but  she takes care  you  you dont wanna be some old man stumbling around like hey you seen any loose milkmy wife  jewish shes  new york jew i did it now i was raised catholic i dont know if you can tell that from  everything about me my wife  jewish i grew up catholic so we got married by  friend being married by  friend   beautiful ceremony that alienates both families religions while confusing  elderly people at  wedding whats  name   bishop thats actually standup comedian dan levy he was  host  mtvs your face or mine i saw  lot  catholic weddings though because i was an altar boy   hush falls over  room isnt it weird how that became  scandalous thing that was just some boring shit i had  do on weekends but now its like saying i was  french maid for  period  time i was treated well  my day i worked for  variety  sirs no being an altar boy was just  boring gig you know youd serve mass  then youd serve weddings sometimes my brother was once an altar boy at  wedding  he was standing there with another altar boy  this big packed church  chicago where we grew up   bride was coming down  aisle   organ was playing  all  pews were filled   bride got all  way   altar   groom lifted  veil off   bride  right at that moment  other altar boy said aw shes ugly  then they looked  they were right next   video camera  i know thats awful but wouldnt you give  million dollars  see that wedding video it was  best moment  this stupid womans life  shes walking down  aisle   organs like  she gets all  way   altar  her betrothed  he unveils her   world    eyes  god  right at that second for no reason at all some cheetofingered ratmustached  prick decides  go aw shes ugly hopefully  videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it  be like aw shes beautiful shes enchantingi grew up catholic i dont go  church anymore but i went on christmas eve with my parents cause you know how you lie  your parents so we go into  church  i was like i got this under control  then i got schooled because they introduced  bunch  new shit no i was going through mass  i was batting like   then   middle  mass  priest said peace be with you  everyone said  with your spirit  i was  one  asshole going  also with you what huh what huh what when when for those  you that arent catholic i dont mean  exclude you even though we love  exclude you but theres  part  church where  priest says peace be with you  for many many years we all said \\u2013  also with you \\u2013 very good but they changed it   with your spirit because thats what needed revamping   catholic church that was  squeaky wheel that needed  grease  rome they were like lets see what problems can we solve problem one no im actually glad they changed that though i never liked  also with you i always found that clunky  also with you thats not how you talk \\u2013 have  nice day \\u2013  also you having one its just  little bit wrong isnt it its just  little off like when someones like how are you  youre like nothing much  it sort  makes sense never begin  sentence with  also you just immediately sound caught offguard it sounds like if at  first church ever like they werent expecting it like  priest was like hey this   first time weve ever had church i just wanna say peace be with you  they were like what oh uh yeah  also you should have some hey thats good lets keep that for  years  then change it  trick johnmy wife  i

constantly every room she walked into shed be like so this could be an office or maybe  nursery yeah no like we said we dont know if were gonna have  no no i know i know you know you dont know if youre gonna have em but you know you know you never know sometimes you dont know whats gonna happen  then you know something happens well yeah thats how all  life works okay all right okay uhhuh mmm

grass out there you know  case you have  couple little guys running around   grass  i got offended on behalf  my imaginary kids i was like hey lady i went outside about as much as powder from  movie powder my children are not gonna be playing out on grass they will be up  their rooms playing violent video games  catfishing pedophiles these are my children  thats my wifei didnt mean  make it sound like we dont want children we dont but i didnt mean  make it sound like that see i just dont think babies like me very much sometimes babies will point at me  i dont care for that shit at all like ill be on an elevator   baby will be there  its big like stroller activity tray just like working on one cheerio with bobby fischerlike intensity  itll look up at me  go i like  lean   go stop snitchin motherfucker  then walk off cause youre never too young  learn our national nosnitching policy my friends have babies  i dont do so well with them i had  runin with  twoyearold girl i know there are better ways  start that story but my friend jeremy has this twoyearold girl  i really like her shes  sweet kid i really like his daughter  lot but i was over at his familys house for  fourth  july  he had his daughter on his knee  it was  very lovely day his whole extended family was there  he was bouncing his twoyearold up  down  he pointed at me  he said  his twoyearold do you know who that  thats your uncle john  i was like oh my god thats so sweet im her uncle john  then  baby pointed at me  said uncle john has  penis i  for laughing because no one did that day fell deadly silent  what they all did hey do you know what youre supposed  say when  baby points at you  knowingly says he has  penis no im asking cause i dont know what  say  that situation heres what i went with that day i said oh come on i dont know i thought thatd be good but then it just made it worse cause it sounded like  baby  i had an arrangement not  talk about it  she had violated my trust like  baby had been like do you have  penis  i was like yes i do but youre  baby so discretion  key  then  next day she goes he has  penis  i go oh come on someone cant keep  secret luckily jeremys wife saved  day  babys mom saved  day she came   she picked up  baby  she was like its okay shes just going through that phase where she says penis  vagina  lot arent we all  by  way it wouldve been  totally different situation if  baby had said vagina like if  grown woman had walked   room   baby had been like she has  vagina  woman could be like yes i do  its magnificent  we would all be like hooray you are brave no one wants  applaud  penis    weirdoits fun  be married ive never been supervised before im supervised she studies what i do like an anthropologist shell be like sometimes he will watch  movie on tv even though he already owns that movie on dvd pointing this out  him confuses  upsets him i had no supervision when i was  kid we were free  do what we wanted but also with that no one cared about kids i grew up before children were special i did very early  right before children became special like i remember when milk carton kids became  thing when they were like hey we should start looking for some  these guys i dont think theyre just blowing off steam no one cared about my opinion when i was  little kid no one cared what i thought sometimes people would say what do you think youre doing but that just meant stop they didnt actually wanna know my thought process they didnt want me  be like well i was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton  eggs so that when i lit off  bottle rocket  eggs would explode everywhere oh well thats very interesting  what brought you  this experiment oh well  for asking well you know how im filled with rage im so horny  angry all  time  i have no outlet for it so eggs your opinion doesnt matter  elementary school either it matters  college college  just your opinion just you raising your hand  being like i think emily dickinsons  lesbian  theyre like partial credit  thats  whole thing but  elementary school it doesnt matter what you think it just matters what you know you have  have answers  questions  if you say i dont know you get an x on your test  you get it wrong  thats not fair cause your brain has never been smaller also thats not how life works im  my  now if you came  me now  you were like hey john name three things that  stamp act   accomplished id go i dont know get out  my apartment you know but when youre  little kid you cant say i dont know you should be able  that should be an acceptable answer on  test you should be able  write  i dont know i know you told me but i have had  very long day i am very small  i have no money so you can imagine  kind  stress that i am under or if its one  those true or false questions you should be able  add  third option which  whos  say kids are much more supervised now but also they have  lot  rights like thats  biggest civil rights increase ive seen  my lifetime  rights  children have gone through  roof i had no rights when i was  little kid i remember one time i walked into  supermarket by myself  i walked  through  double doors   woman behind  register just looked at me  she went no  i went all right  i turned around  left thats how broken i wasand there werent special things for kids  way there are now like we would just go see movies any movie like back   future that was  movie everyone could see kids could kinda see it great movie right i rewatched it recently its  very weird movie marty mcfly    high school student whose best friend   disgraced nuclear physicist  i shit you not they never explain how they became friends they never explain it not even   lazy way like hey remember when we met   science building they dont even do that  we were all fine with it we were just like what whos his best friend  disgraced nuclear physicist all right proceed what  strange movie  sell  be  family movie two guys had  go   do that they had  be like okay we got an idea for  next big familyactioncomedy all right its about  guy named marty  hes very lazy hes always sleeping late okay  he cool like ferris bueller no but he does have this best friend whos you know  disgraced nuclear physicist im confused here this best friend this  another student no no no no this guys either like  or  even we dont know how old this guys supposed  be but one day  boy   scientist they go back  time  they build  time machine whoa okay i think i see where youre going here they build  time machine  they go back  time  they stop  kennedy assassination ah oh wow thats  really good idea i mean we didnt even think  that all right well what do they do with  time machine well now im embarrassed  say ah well all right all right all right we thought we thought it would be funny you know if  boy if he went back  time  you know he tried  fuck his mom i dont know we thought thatd be fun for people but no good point no he doesnt get  he doesnt get  cause this family friend named biff he comes   he tries  rape  mom  front   son  dads gotta beat  rapist off  her  also were gonna imply that  white man wrote johnny b goode so were gonna take that away from em well this   best movie idea i have ever heard  my life were gonna make three  them now you say they go   past how about we call it back   past no no no back   future right but they go   past yeahkids have it very good now my friends  teacher she told me that uh  parents will take  kids side over  teacher now thats insane that never happened my parents trusted every grownup more than they trusted me i dont mean coaches  teachers any human adults word was better than mine any hobo or drifter could have taken me by  ear up  my front door  been like excuse me your kid bit my dick  my mom would be like john edmund mulaney did you bite this nice mans dick  i would be  only one whos like hey doesnt anyone wanna know why his dick was near my biters   first place isnt anyone curious as  how i had access dont get me wrong my parents love us they just didnt like us we werent friends people are now like my moms my best friend i was like oh  she  super bad mom my parents didnt trust us  they shouldnt have trusted us we were little goblins we were terrible i remember one time we were going  this resort for  vacation when we were little kids three weeks before we went   resort my dad sat us down  he said all right were going   resort  ive just been informed that  man who owns  resort only has one arm  we were like oh yes yay yes now im telling you three weeks  advance so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm oh were gonna freak out so bad yes john you have  question how did he lose his arm thats exactly what you wont ask  then i did ask i went into  kitchen one day  i was like so howd you lose your arm  he was like well i was born with only one arm  i was like nahno my parents loved us its just like they were  cops you know  we were criminals so we didnt get along we only got along  that way that like cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals like when my dad  i would talk it was like that scene   movie heat when robert de niro  al pacino sit down  that diner we kind  had that rapport  like hmm were not so different you  i you have your law practice  me i have all these fucking markers i guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way my dad would respect it if i could get away with breaking  rule we had  rule  our house you were not allowed  watch tv on  school night so every school night i would  be watching tv  i would hear my dad coming i would immediately turn  tv off  grab any book magazine periodical anything  id open it  pretend  be doing homework my dad would walk   room  he would go what are you doing are you watching tv  id go no man im not watching tv   tv wouldnt even be dark yet it would still have like  neon green halo around it itd be sizzling like  glass  pepsi  i would look my dad   eyes  go no im just reading this yellow pagesmy dad loved us he just didnt care about our general happiness or selfesteem i remember one time we were really little kids i have two sisters   brother  all four  us were  our family car ride for three hours going  wisconsin my dad was driving going down  highway  our white van with wood around  side cause you remember when you wanted your car  be made  wood you remember that era where we were like how much wood can we get on this car without it catching on fire but then  big announcement we here at plymouthchrysler can put  saucy stripe  wood safely on  outside  your car for all those times youve looked at your minivan  thought huh it needs  belt so were going on  highway weve been on  road for three hours    distance we see  mcdonalds we see  golden arches  we got so excited we started chanting mcdonalds mcdonalds mcdonalds mcdonalds  my dad pulled into  drivethru  we started cheering  then he ordered one black coffee for himself  kept driving  you know as mad as that made me as  little kid  retrospect that   funniest thing i have ever seen  my entire life how perfect  that he had  vanload  little kids  he got black coffee  one thing from mcdonalds no child could enjoy my dad  coldblooded he once shushed  kid during lion king on broadway that actually happened we were at lion king on broadway  there was  fiveyearold behind us going look its pumbaa look its timon  my dad turned around  said are you going  talk  entire time hes my herothe weirdest thing when i was  kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed they scared us about it constantly  ive been on tour this year marijuana  legal   or  states  some form or another its insane yeah well all right dont whoo if youre white its always been legal for us come on sir we dont go  jail for marijuana you silly billy when i was arrested with  onehitter at  rusted root concert i did not serve hard time i think i got an award eighteen or  states  by  way i agree its  very good thing but its also  really weird thing because this   first time ive ever seen  law change because  government  just like fine you know ive never seen it before like gay marriage  healthcare we have  battle it out   supreme court  be like gay people are humans  theyre like well think about it but with weed it was just something we wanted really badly  we kept asking them for  years like excuse me  then suddenly  government became like cool parents  theyre just like okay here take  little wed rather you do it   house than go somewhere else blah blah blah blah blah those stupid parents  thats  big deal because they scared us about weed constantly it would be on our sitcoms wed be watching saved by  bell wed be having  great old time  then suddenly  character we had not seen before would show up with some weed   episode would stop cold  its tracks  theyd always hold  joint  bad guy would hold  joint   villainous way theyd always offer  joint   way that no one ever holds  joint like its  skull   shakespeare play  now its legal  that  great news unless youre  weed dealer  then it  terrible news  i dont just mean because theyre about  lose out  amazoncom i more feel bad for weed dealers cause theyre about  find out that we only showed them  certain amount  politeness because they had an illegal product  we dont show that same politeness  people who deliver legal products like when  chinese food delivery guy comes we dont let him hang out after hes delivered  chinese food  we dont look  other way when he says weird shit   girls were hanging out with  try  preserve  relationship  we definitely dont give him some   chinese food hes never like hey can i get  on those dumplings  were like yeah were all friendswhat are you on your phone hey vneck hey \\u2013 whats your name \\u2013 sam sam cool what do you do  afford vnecks sam typing numbers ah numbers  letters  math im sorry  bother you i dont mean  single you out i hate when people get pulled out   audience like are you familiar with  cirque du soleil sam theyre  group  french assholes that are slowly taking over america by humiliating audience members one by one we once went  see cirque du soleil at navy pier when i was  kid  my brother came  he was  years old you remember being  when youre like no one look at me or ill kill myself  these french bastards come into

worked at an office once on  street  new york city i was there for  couple weeks i was   cubicle next  this other cubicle this woman named mischa sat   other cubicle i want  get  number right i think mischa had about  photos  her daughter up  her cubicle almost like she was trying  solve  conspiracy about her daughter  beautiful mindstyle i think about mischa two times  week because   phone call she had next  me one day it was one  my first days  i was sitting next  her  her phone rang  this was her call  im quoting her phone rang  she said  hush  then she hung up think about that two times  week  i didnt know her well enough by then  be like hey what kind   person are you you know who could she have been talking   hush this was  place  business my only thought was that it was  ceo   company being like mischa help im doing  crossword puzzle i need  fourletter word for be quiet right now \\u2013 hush \\u2013 youre promotedi temped at  little web company on  street  new york city it was  small web company owned by this old man who was old old old money new york his name was henry j finch iv like old old old money like his money was  molasses or something he owned this web company i have no idea why he owned this web company i think he won it   rich mans game  dice  small binoculars or something mr finch wore linen suits he had suspenders he had  bow tie he had  hat he had  cane with an ivory handle im giving you more description than you need cause i need you  believe me this was  real person i knew    century mr finch was  his  he had an assistant named mary she was  her  she was korean i dont know why he had an assistant he did not need one unless he needed someone  be like remember mr finch at five oclock you need  keep looking like  hardboiled egg one day mr finch came into  office it had been raining everything im about  say  you was said  front  me on that afternoon mr finch walked into  office  he was wearing  raincoat he was wearing  rain hat  he had his cane  he walked   he said  im quoting ah one feels like  duck splashing around  all this wet  when one feels like  duck one  happy  then mary yelled ooh ducklings  which mr finch replied too old  be  duckling quack quack  then walked into his office i think about that every goddamn day i mean imagine youre me youre   temp  youre so hungover  you just wanna die every day  then that happens  front  you  i dont know gives you hope  i did that  little fast let me break that conversation down for you mr finch walked   he began  conversation  way anyone would ah one feels like  duck splashing around  all this wet  rain  when one feels like  duck one  happy now thats debatable but rather than debate that point mary brought up  new separate but interesting point which was ducklings but mr finch ever  realist about his own age  mortality said ah too old  be  duckling as if  say my duckling days are behind me mary dont you see im  duck now   prove it well ill say just about  most famous catchphrase  duck has quack quack  i knew right at that moment by  way that it meant nothing  mr finch what he had said crazy people are like that they have unlimited crazy currency like if i had gone into his office  couple weeks later  been like hey finch you remember that time you were like too old  be  duckling quack quack he would just be like ah perhaps i did quack but such  life for an old knickerbocker like me like hed say something else crazythats  wonderful thing about crazy people you know  that they just have unlimited currency  things they say mean nothing  them but they mean everything  me i was once walking into penn station  new york i was walking down  street towards eighth avenue im walking down  theres this woman standing at eighth   i have my little roller suitcase you can all imagine im walking towards her shes smoking  cigarette that  not lit anymore shes watching me walk kind  scanning me up  down as if she had terminator vision where she could see little bits  data like little honky ass  could read information as i walked past her she said this  me i walked past her  she said  im quoting eat ass suck  dick  sell drugs very dirty yes  very upsetting thing  hear yes im sorry you all had  hear that but at least you all got  hear it as  group i was alone out there that afternoon  she said this totally unprompted eat ass suck  dick  sell drugs it wasnt like i had paused  front  her  been like what should i do with my life so i walk away from her with this todo list  i like structure i like  todo list it did dawn on me that that list  things does get better as it goes along when you really think about it cause it starts   pretty rough place it starts with just about  worst task  todo list can start with but by  end you have your own small business  isnt that  american dream when alls said  done that if you eat enough ass  suck enough dick one day you can sell drugs imagine you did all that  sell drugs  then they legalize drugs  you were like but i this has been  real thrill  perform here by  way i just wanna say that  all sincerity thanks for coming  this really really appreciate iti wanna tell you one more story before i get out  here about  night i met  guy named bill clinton now i dont some  you know who that  for those  you that dont he was president   united states from  until   he   smooth  fantastic hillbilly who should be declared emperor   united states  america now i know you know who bill clinton  but i was doing  show at  college  i mentioned bill clinton  like they kind  didnt know who he was like sorry

 lot wrong not just with this theres hundreds  prescription drugs that we all took or  lot  us  then over  years they pulled them off  market because they said they were safe  effective  then found out they werent safe or effective\\u2013 or trans fats which are fats that hate dave chappelleoohwhat no trans fats are  ones they were telling us  eat  years ago  now theyre illegal  by  way lets back up  that ooh cause\\u2013 let me make this clear okay im very supportive   trans community im also super supportive  free speech  i love anybody who wont let  mob tell them what  say about anything people say  me\\u2013  people say  me you know bill you make fun   left more than you used  yeah fuck right i do  part  it  because thats free speech i take it  little personally you know free speech used  be  liberal thing but then they got it  their head that getting their feelings hurt was more important than  first amendment they do this all  time they do something nutty  then they blame me for noticing  say oh youre  republican now im not  republican  i never have been so lets get that shit off  table im not  republican for all  reasons i never have been before theyre too religious theyre fiscal hypocrites who absolutely hate it when america spends money it doesnt have except when theyre  office  then its always perfectly okay um theyre  denial about racism which  still  thing they think climate change   hoax   weather girls tits are real  theyre always blaming  underprivileged when they should be blaming  overprivileged  then they\\u2013 they added  that shitty mix tape they dont believe  democracy anymore  have  new policy\\u2013 elections only count when we win so they have  comfortable lead  being  bigger threat but i dont hold my tongue for anybodyyou know for  two years when i was trying  get biden  step down i kept referring  him as ruth bader biden kind  true wasnt it  you know people would\\u2013when people were about people would say  me oh bill stop making fun  bidens age youre gonna help trump right like no one would have noticed otherwise i\\u2013 yeah i  cat out   bag about bidens age no im  noticer thats what i do its what im supposed  do so if i notice all  oversensitivity on  left   victim culture   cancel culture   overemphasis on identity politics   pointless white selfloathing that goes on ugh dont tell me  left hasnt changed im old enough  remember when it was  conservatives who hated  jews  so you can threaten me with every label you want i dont bend  knee if you do something goofy im gonna call you out no matter where you are on  spectrum i speak   different group  people who are not ideologically captured by either sidefuck yeahdemocrats independents  nondrooling republicans\\u2013 thats my constituency people that are just tired   extremes as i am tired   extremes   extremists who control  debate but who dont represent close   majority im tired   hating   haters i dont hate half america  i dont wanna hate half americathats rightand ill tell you something about america its complicated more complicated than people give credit like there are country music stars now with face tattoos  governor  kansas   woman  california has never had  woman governor okay its  little complicated we have  new vice president jd vance who wrote  book about being  hillbilly called hillbilly elegy   it he says when he was eight years old he lived with his grandma who was born    kentucky  had  shotguns okayand he says  her i think im gay which i completely related  because when i was eight years old well they hadnt invented homosexuality but\\u2013 but i knew what it was like  only like boys cause girls have cooties when youre eight so he goes  his grandmother  he says grandma am i gay  she says\\u2013this  word for word   book\\u2013 she says jd do you wanna suck dicksand he says no i dont  she says well then youre not gay but even if you did wanna suck dicks god would still love you okay well you know what if jd vances cocksuckerloving grandma can be that openminded maybe theres hope that were better than we think but i am not looking forward  trump  because i already did all  jokes  theres just\\u2013with him theres too much material you know usually with  president theres like one thing that we all latch onto you know bush was stupid  clinton was horny \\u2013 but this guy  everything you know hes stupid  hes horny  hes crazy  hes fat  hes hot for his daughter  he has  mushroom dick according \\u2013   mushroom dick really well thats what stormy daniels said  she hints that there   sex tape  that we could actually get  see trumps penisand you can tell its trumps penis because it has  big sign on  top\\u2013 trump penis  also its  sean hannitys mouth thats  other way you put it gentle good humor thats what we do here\\u2013 gentle good humor well you gotta give trump this i mean  skill at performance art remember that day he had his ear piercedand by  way if you think theres only conspiracy theorists on  right i cant tell you how many people came up  me around that time bill dont you think that assassination attempt was staged staged walk me through how you could stage  bullet hitting just  tip  your ear from  feet away yeah shoot at my head i trust you but just graze me just\\u2013its  new shirt i dont wanna get  lot\\u2013you know  who  perform this incredible feat  marksmanship mclovin from  movie superbad so\\u2013  you have  admit that  shot was fired because there was  guy behind trump right who got hit  died by  way that  so onbrand for donald trump that he gets shot at  another guy dies hes\\u2013isnt it i mean hes jesus  reverse other people die for his sins but\\u2013but as soon as it happened  republicans i mean immediately they had  narrative god\\u2013god did it i mean  blood had not dried on his foundation when they were\\u2013 divine intervention he  risen  i kept asking what about  other guy who got shot what does god say about him yeah shit happens i cant be everywhere i mean thats always been my thing about religion really you know just too easy too easy you know its because people want  believe so badly that you dont really have  make  big effort i mean what do you have  be  just start  religion  be  prophet just some guy\\u2013  i do mean guy cause it  kind   sausage party  prophet business but just some guy who was out   middle  nowhere you know   mountains or up on  hill or   desert  come running into town\\u2013 hey everybody youll never guess who talked  me when there was nobody around darn  luck\\u2013 god yeah can you believe it god  he said hes starting  new religion  he wants me  complete loser with nothing going on  my life  be his infallible wingman here on earth isnt that awesome so i took  few notes okay number one just do whatever i say thats like super key  uh oh yeah im gonna have  be fucking  lot   women   compound thats just directly from him i would not have it that way but you know religion its not exactly selling consistency its not even really selling morality what  it selling peace  mind thats what its selling i know this because i know many religious people  they all say  same thing which  when i put my head on  pillow at night i know if i die  my sleep i will go   better place  which i always say then why dont you hang yourself tomorrow i\\u2013 no im trying  help you said  better place i\\u2013i have some rope  my car we could do this tonight but\\u2013when people ask  question what happens when i die they dont wanna hear uhuhuh uh something nothing no they wanna hear mm\\u2013  they wanna hear we have  postlife package that i think youre gonna find very exciting because\\u2013 cause that  what they are selling i mean thats\\u2013 thats actually what theyre competing with each other for they have  come up with  great heaven\\u2013 version  heaven like i was raised catholic i was told one man dies for all  your sins which  really picking up  check for  whole table i\\u2013 that   gentleman um mormons mormons believe that if you have  good marriage here on earth   afterlife you  your wife get  rule over your own planet that   nice perk  it not i\\u2013 let me see that brochure im gonna look at this very carefully i love  muslims they go right  you get pussy what do you think about that pussy pussy pussy everywhere hmm well that brochure\\u2013 although i suppose if i ruled over my own planet i get all  pussy i want oh wait  old ball  chain will be with me give me  muslim one again but i mean you know religion  politics very similar  that way that its  lot about promises that they can never keep but people just wanna believe i mean anytime trump\\u2013you see him  front  one  his rallies hes always got  giant banner behind him that says promises kept  who  asbestos industry who did this guy ever keep  promise toyou know i mean  health care\\u2013remember that thing he was\\u2013amazing something terrific  he didnt even come up with concepts   plan not even concepts   plan he   typical overpromising con man hes  guy who says   woman i am gonna give you  best orgasm you ever had  then comes putting on  condom you know that guy thats\\u2013this \\u2013 i mean even his wall that big stupid thing he was gonna build  he couldnt even build  wall  stop mexicans from coming here  taking your jobs  stupidest political premise ive ever heard  ive been hearing it my whole life like you people would pick crops right oh no i get it i get it i get it because you know what sometimes i take  drive up from la  san francisco   you pass mile after mile  lettuce fields  im just burning up   car god damn these bastards have it all locked up i wanted  get  on that  there i wanted my kids  get into  lettuce field  they cant do it i mean  panic that goes through fox news whenever theres  caravan\\u2013 ah  caravan  brown walkers heading north  take your jobs take your jobs have you ever seen whos   caravan let me tell you if an  honduran boy can take your job you made vocational choices  long time ago that i think have  lot more  do with this  i have so much more respect for that honduran kid than i do for american kids who cant make it   mailbox without an epipen   gps tracking device i mean middleclass americans should be so grateful  immigrants because like middleclass people have things that when i was  kid nobody had except  rich\\u2013maids nannies housekeepers landscapers gardeners these things didnt exist when i was  child are you kidding  idea that my father would have help yeah he had help\\u2013me me  fabulous family  mexicans i was i could do it allbut\\u2013love you billi love you too thats an odd time  declare your love but i appreciate it well heres  question for democrats why does trump keep doing better each time with immigrants thats pretty amazing  i think i know why its because liberals dont really look like they like america  immigrants dont like  relentless negativity about  country they worked so hard  get  you know theyre\\u2013 theyre not obsessed with what happened  years ago  they dont see this country only through shitstained glasses ask them why they came here  they will tell you ron desantis put them on  plane but\\u2013 also  other stuffno i feel like were raising  bunch  ahistorical americahating hysterics  this country  you know whenever i talk  my friends who have kids  their  or their teens theyre always bitching  me about how their kids are driving them crazy with their outofcontrol wokeness  everything  thats old thinking mom you dont get it mom you dont get it get what defund  police tear down statues  lincoln give communism another try get rid   border patrol get rid  capitalism you can be healthy at any weight its cool  have penises  womens shelters  womens prisons no i dont get it not cause im old because your ideas are stupid thats what i dont get just cause theyre new it doesnt make them better new isnt automatically better i could come  tomorrow  go hey from now on lets eat   bathroom  shit   kitchen its new  this  one   problems i think we have  this country nobody ever gets canceled for being too woke thats how you get things like men can get pregnant  everybodys like uh yeah absolutely ive always said that  course i saw  dude today glowing   i think  lot  people are just tired  having  pretend that things that are crazy arent tired  being bullied by  most unfun people   country tired  walking around on eggshells because   hyper fragile   oversensitivethese people\\u2013  these people who have such  sense  entitlement about never having  feel  moment  discomfort from encountering  thought they dont already have or  joke they dont like fuck off you fucks fuck you eloquent huh  oh  \\u2013 there anything more cringeworthy than  apologies that we have  listen  from people so often that you know sound like theyre right out   soviet reeducation camp where you\\u2013 you thank your accusers   for  opportunity  learn what  repulsive shitbag i am  i will try  do better oh fuck off it was  halloween costume nobody died okay i mean so much  this  just posing you know liberalism isnt about lifting this  posing do you ever see when they do one  those land acknowledgments have you ever seen that okay when theyre about  like put   mini mall or whatever  fuck theyre gonna do anyway they have  little ceremony so they can tell you how bad they feel about it first we are standing on land that rightfully belongs   proud chumash people okay either give it back or shut  fuck up all right come on like youd really rather have  teepee there than your starbucks  i know when people hear  word woke it triggers them  i understand that because it started out as  great thing\\u2013 alert  injustice were all for that but words migrate i cant control that  now like so many things its been taken over by stupid white peoplewhooand there\\u2013 theres not one right there not  stupid white person theres one   good onesand its just about catching people you know  couple  years ago they went after dr seuss yes that dr seuss author  green eggs  ham  other controversial works why because when he was drawing    he drew chinese people with pigtails possibly because    chinese people wore pigtails so i would say if youre gonna be  cartoonist\\u2013  little advice\\u2013if youre gonna draw anybody ethnic i would be very careful like if youre drawing \\u2013 jewish person i would make that nose very small very small like michael jackson after  third operation small\\u2013 just  jew dot right   middle   face but you know why are pigtails racist  begin with theyre not   point these people just like  bitch they just like  find something  bitch about bitches  snitches\\u2013 thats what this country  you know i said  little while ago about little people remember okay so little people thats what youre supposed  say now midget\\u2013bad bad word  me this makes so much more sense if it had happened  reverse if we had been saying little people then they would have went oh for gods sake bill use  proper term like midget jesus christ you dont call them little people theyre not toys whats wrong with you midget  then somebody would have come along no no theyre  wee we call them  wee now no theyre people experiencing weeness  \\u2013i mean i feel people\\u2013 i think people think that wokeism  somehow an extension  liberalism but more often its  opposite let me give you  million examples homeless\\u2013youre not supposed  say that word anymore its people experiencing homelessness i dont think that goes far enough i think we should call them wonderful wellmeaning people who through no fault  their own are taking  dump on my driveway that i believe   term we should be looking for but you know i have  little insight into this i used  participate  this show for my beloved wonderful hbo called comic relief remember comic relief with whoopi  billy  robin okay all right well were good liberals we thought we were do\\u2013  compassionate view was get  homeless off  street thats not  woke view their view   homeless  theyre an endangered species that needs  be protected  their natural habitat\\u2013 living their best life under  bridge liberalism  about fixing things woke  about you know\\u2013  lot  it  just renaming colleges every year many many colleges put out lists  words  phrases we are not supposed  say anymore really dangerous stuff like master bedroom you know white paper blacklist insane  on  list id say thats insane but its on  list  it pisses me off because you know its bad enough they took away  rword which  so desperately needed because this country  so r youre not supposed  say reservation i guess thats offensive  indians what are you supposed  say when you go out  dinner um\\u2013 hi we have um\\u2013were supposed  eat hereand you know somewhere along here  where somebody says oh bill its so easy  pick on  fringe it  but its not  fringe anymore it really isnt  washington post isnt  fringe listen  this okay so you know mrbeast  youtuber he puts on these amazing stunts very often for charity  he did one last year called cured  people  disability paid for  tent all these doctors come  they restored eyesight   people good thing right wrong  washington post guy said what needs curing  societys view   disabled  buzzfeed agreed they said mrbeast seems  regard disability as something that needs  be solved okay people do you see what im talking about with  crazy please  anyone else seeing this yes   jesus let me tell you something folks if i have  disability do something fix me i wont be insulted okay do what you have  do steal stem cells from  frog ai\\u2013i dont know\\u2013 harvest organs whatever  fuck you have  do but dont sit around  talk about how awesome i am  how im just as good as you despite whatever fucked up thing i have fix me like its cooler  be differently abled huh yeah who wants  be like mr mainstream over there with all his limbs ughbut i could do this all day proving that its not just fringe but lets just do one more scientific american\\u2013 cant get much more mainstream than that scientific american now believes that  only reason  los angeles lakers would reliably crush any wnba team  because  societal bias   atlantic agrees  atlantic put out  cover story last year called separating sports by sex doesnt make sense um yes it fucking does it makes perfect sense  i mean they actually wrote  sentence maintaining  binary  sports reinforces  idea\\u2013  idea this   idea\\u2013 that men are bigger stronger  faster than women  notion thats been disputed by scientists for years it has where  new england journal  what  fuck it hasnt been challenged anywhere  its not just an idea that men are bigger stronger  faster than women  this   root   problem that you cant\\u2013 we spoil  kids so much they think you can change reality just by screaming at it we raised kids wrong like theyre just shorter adults\\u2013 always blowing smoke up their little asses  calling them tiny geniuses telling them their thoughts are just as valid as  adults theyre not theyre children theyre stupid like dogs \\u2013  you know\\u2013 you could say oh bill you dont have kids how would you know because im  peoples houses that do sometimes  i see this all  time kids as young as ten will invite themselves into  adult conversations  no one stops it i mean if i ever did this\\u2013 i remember my parents   living room with their friends if i ever just walked \\u2013 ive had some thoughts about  vietnam war that i think everyone\\u2013 get  fuck out  here so we raise them wrongthen we send them  these asshole factories called elite universities really let me tell you if ignorance was  disease harvard yard would be  wuhan wet market  then  kids get out  theyre like theres no good jobs yeah because you majored  queer poetry   asian diaspora  course theres no jobs you went   fouryear daycare center for  cry bullies   privileged  complain about privilege that  when you werent protesting for terrorist organizations really really marching for hamas its like rooting for  planes on i said thats like rooting for  planes on \\u2013  i know you\\u2013i knew youd agree with it if you just gave it  minute i know its kind  shocking at first but hey kids i have  great idea for you since you love hamas  hezbollah so much why dont you next year take your gap year  iran uh\\u2013no no youre gonna dig it you will dig it make sure  bring your queers for palestine tshirt theyre very popular over there  if you see  ayatollah tell him your pronouns he loves that  you wonder why  left catches more jokes from me they changed not me okay things changed just  five years things changed  lot five years ago penises meant something now its like congratulations you had  boy well lets not be hasty what  penis oh come on thats not really relevant anymore  it its  small factor but i\\u2013 i\\u2013i thought it was like  sixth toe at this point just  useless vestigial appendage i mean i understand now when they circumcise they very often lop  whole thing off  just save us time later when it becomes toxic  they are kind  cavalier are they not about gender reassignment  make it sound like so simple  easy cut one off snap one on i mean\\u2013 no its not its  major medical intervention thats going  affect your health for  rest  your life we just gloss over this you know that when they give you  penis youre not born with\\u2013 im not mocking this or making fun  it but they literally\\u2013they cut  flesh out  your thigh  forevermore you have  dickshaped scaragain im not mocking it maybe its  selling point  some places but\\u2013 i mean with so many people doing this isnt there some better way some sort  exchange have  penis give  penis need  penis take  penis i mean there have  be solutions people but again you know liberals understand  appreciate  love  fact that there are variations  human sexuality  its great we live   time when trans people can be respected  protected as they should be but some  this  also just trendy some  this   tiktok challenge that got out  hand  we are  only country who does it  way we do now all  other liberal countries   world they pulled back because they went with common sense  said you know what kids are\\u2013you know go through phases childhood  all phases what   kitty phase  dinosaur phase one minute you cant get them out   room  next minute they wanna be an astronaut if kids knew what they wanted  be at five  world would be full  cowboys  princesses i wanted  be  pirate thank god they didnt take me seriously  scheduled me for eye removal  peg leg surgeryall right one more thing about this  then ill go back  making fun  republicans but\\u2013 but its interesting when i was traveling this year cause its an election year  many states\\u2013 red states blue states\\u2013 i saw all  ads  congressional people have up there  its interesting  democrat ads not one  them ever uses  word liberal because its got so mixed up with woke bullshit that theyre embarrassed by it but  republicans cannot say  word conservative enough its  conservative brad gunsberg   conservative for conservative pennsylvania brad gunsberg will kill criminals  bomb mexico  tear  dress off your son brad gunsberg conservative will legalize horse fighting  turn electric cars into electric chairs brad gunsberg   conservative  those arent even  scary republican ads no ive been  states where they dont even mention policy its just  guy with  gun shooting at some shit he dont like   truck gun truck truck gun me like these things you like vote me really its on that level its\\u2013 oh its amazing what republicans like these days i would never have guessed russia they like russia fox news loves russia wow thats  big one  you know we know  lot now about  typical fox news viewer their average age  between   decomposing they are overwhelmingly white they feel very cheated  they think  themselves as very patriotic well let me stop you right there if you think what happened on january  attacking  us capitol  overturn  free  fair election  an act  patriotism youre   bigger bubble than  one i just described on  left okay im no constitutional scholar but i dont think it says  case  loss install your guy anyway so yes ill say it again  left  infuriating with their aggressively anticommon sense agenda but that can be handled through normal legislative means  elections but what  right  doing\\u2013 not conceding elections\\u2013 no when thats gone its gone forever its like virginity  then youre  whore  that what you wanna be america  whore  dont answer thatand you know people say  me well but bill  system held no it didnt really  only reason we had  smooth transition  that  one party  this country that still concedes elections lost thats  only reason it was smooth so  system didnt really hold   system still sucks i mean  electoral college its  only thing worse than regular college i mean if thomas jefferson was alive he would have two questions one hamilton gets  musical before me  two were still using that thing from  i mean i live  california with  million people  we get two senators   dakota territory gets four why are there two dakotas why  there one there are more people  california named dakota not that california  not an insane state because it  oh it  i once tried  cut down  tree i had  like it  my backyard cant do that  california i had  clear it with  city  state  environmental review board  fish  game people  parks department  un security council    berkeley students who are now living   tree  wont come down until i admit it has  soul  look i wanna be  good environmentalist i have tried i think  best thing i ever did for  cause was i never spawned no not\\u2013 this  not knocking kids kids are wonderful  important they assembled my phone but um\\u2013 well come on lets be honest everybody hates kids these days i mean how can you not theyre feral they are theyre obnoxious undisciplined completely out  control im convinced this  why anal  so popular these days no really because you know condoms break pills can fail but no sperm ever made it out   shit chute alive you know its  real selling point if you dont want kids \\u2013 but you know  abortion thing look i personally am prochoice but you know id like  stand up  little for  prolife people because they always get accused  you hate women youre just\\u2013 they dont hate women you just made that up they dont hate women they think its murder  it kind   im just okay with that sorry unborn theres  billion  us here alreadywe wont miss you what can i say how could we we never met you  you never met us how could you miss us this  not  tragedy oh bill all life  precious really you know i mean i\\u2013 harvey weinstein jeff dahmer hitler i could name people you know

ive said  lot  bad things about  kids  i just\\u2013 i just wanna say one thing from  bottom  my heart i really think that theres never been  harder time  be  parent  my hat  off  anybody whod be  parent because you cant boss kids around anymore my parents would be arrested today arrested for raising us just  way everybody did you know walking alone\\u2013 oh christ call  what i used  come home every day from school i would fly up  my room get into my play clothes fly out  door my mother never once said where are you going where am i going kid stuff im gonna do kid stuff what  fuck  it  you where im going im gonna do whatever i do between     you do whatever  fuck you do between     ill see you at dinner where am i going nosy bitch jesus where am i going i mean i feel like yeah i dont have kids but everything i see with them its just so assbackwards you know what i hear  lot my kid  my hero what shes six whos your kid anne frank for christs sakes  like i mean i see kids  tv  movies  you know like  parents always apologizing   kids you know everything\\u2013 sorry buddy i let you down buddy you know cause dad cheated or something okay well you know daddy gets erections maybe when you get erections youll be  little more forgiving theyre hard  refuse my whole life people have been saying you know dont let your dick rule your life dont think with your dick well why not its gonna win anywayhonestly my dick  like  dinosaurs  jurassic park theyre gonna get out okay  theyre gonna get out \\u2013 this may be why i never got married i dont know but\\u2013 which  not that rare anymore i feel  yet people are endlessly fascinated by this like why didnt you ever get married ill tell you its not that complicated its just personal taste like okay heres  number one reason whenever i ask married people like about  marriage  answer  always some variation  well its tough you know its uh its  lot  work its  lot  work its\\u2013its never yippee oh ho ho ho okay i dont wanna work does that make me shallow i dont care thats who i am i dont wanna work just like i dont wanna go on  hike unless you like hiking see some people do its just personal taste i went on one hike once oh god i hated it it was like  years ago i had  girlfriend had  dog  i had  dog she said lets take  dogs on  hike oh fuck it was fucking hot  dusty i hated  other hikers my dog got about  feet  just went fuck this  laid down on \\u2013hes like im not doing this hiking   fur coat   summer jesus okay so\\u2013 heres another thing that scares me about marriage sometimes im   restaurant i see across  way theres  table   couple sitting across from each other  theyre not speaking  i know theyre married  uh theyre not mad at each other they just ran out  conversation   its \\u2013 every once   while one  them will burble up some well i see  school  getting  new coat  paint i just wanna walk over  place  revolver down on  table  say if either one  you wants  use this on yourself or each other everyone here will understand completely therell be no judgment so\\u2013  yes i have never actually been married but ive been  longterm monogamous relationships i get  drill i know what it  i bet you i\\u2013 i bet you i share this feeling that weve all had  longterm relationships tell me if this isnt true that you know sometimes youre\\u2013 youre home with your loved one your spouse whatever  theyre about  leave for  airport on  trip  im not saying you wish  plane would go down but it would solve  lot  problems  it really wouldno i know its terrible its terrible  whenever ive had that feeling  thought that i felt terrible for  other  people on  plane who have  die so that i can be happy again but something had  give  okay just one more thing also when marriages go bad sometimes they go so bad\\u2013 i dont know if you saw this it didnt get  lot  coverage but  couple  years ago johnny depp got divorced oh you did see that okay well i mean  things they did  each other i mean i may not be  johnny depp but no girl ever shit  my bed okay  i did once have  fight about  bed it wasnt about that not about shit but\\u2013 i will preface this by saying i think women are perfect ethereal creatures  i will fight anybody who says differentwhoothank you but once   blue moon you get one whos  little pushy just once   blue moon  this girl\\u2013 we werent even together that long  she says  me i want you  get  new bed i said what i want you  get  new bed why youve had other girls  that bed i said youve had other men  your vagina but are we gonna get  new one  those for crying\\u2013but i gotta say i think that  woman getting mad at you for having had other women  your bed its just more evidence that humans arent really that different i know  kids think that they can reinvent humanity  that were all fluid now  gay  trans  nonbinary  on  spectrum but were not how do i know were not because  bachelor  still on thats how i know so\\u2013 look again if youre not that

 cat  shit   litter box but\\u2013  im happy\\u2013 im happy for you that you live now   age   internet because before  internet those kind  lives if you were different must have been very lonely but

only  which i know  not technically highrisk but my body was starting  show signs  change  it\\u2013  it scared me like im only   my pussy  not as wet as it used  be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old  your pussy was just sopping wet all  time all  time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up  peace sign afterwards  there would be that snailtrail  between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow  bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbustersi dont know what kind  mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im   i did have  get  little bit  science involved when trying  get pregnant   lot  that  most likely my fault because when i was  my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like  smokers lung  i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had  take these hormone pills that were suppositories  push pop them up myself every single night  then at my writing job at fresh off  boat i would be storyboarding  front  my coworkers  then at some point  pill would inevitably dissolve  melt into my underwear  i had  act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok  then  side effect   progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had  find ways  discretely scratch myself underneath  conference table  then resist  urge  immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want  be able  smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch  sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make  sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about  when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find  way  smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious  protect you cause you gotta check that its all good   hood if its too funky you need  see  doctor your fingers are your first webmdwhen my husband  i were trying  have  kid  lot  people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin  lot  fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do  your  ok when \\u2013 when youre  your   youve been trying  get pregnant for  while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when  eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time  i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out   month  outside  that i would be like were not fuckin i need you  save it i want your sperm  be as pentup  as angry  rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release  kraken  they just come out like  bunch  angry refugees escaping  dictatorship you know  um yeah  most   time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home  see  smiley face on  ovulation strip  id be like ok its go time  i would just give my husband  hand job most   time  he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre  such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need  close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying  shut  image  your face out  their head  instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto  back  their eyelids which  fine by me because then he doesnt have  see  expression on my face that says please hurry  fuck up  then when he was about  finish i could always tell because  indication  very universal when  man  about  finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by  zombie just  then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me   eye  remember  come with intention ok  then i would jump on him  hold onto his neck  i would just twerk twerk twerk  shit out  him  do some  this shit that i learned  atlanta  then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards  make sure all  that harvard nectar would just drain inside  me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymoreim very grateful  be pregnant   be this far along  be seven   half months pregnant because last year i had  miscarriage which  very common   lot  women who are  their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark  terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty  women who have had  miscarriage its super common  i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from  third world country  when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing  pair  shoes its whatevs ok  everything happens for  reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which  very early   doctor says  me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins  i was like no  then she said but what i dont see   heartbeat  i was like yes  lord  mysterious dont feel bad ok they were  size  poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than  twins that i lost  most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through  miscarriage i sat my husband down  front  me while i sat on  toilet  i was like you look you watch  whole thing  he felt so bad for me  i used it as leverage  held that shit over his head for  month  got him  do whatever  fuck i wanted him  do for  days he took me  see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me  bike off  craigslist thats my miscarriage bike  i love it very much for  days i finally had  marriage i always wantedim scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared  childbirth thats why im going  hire  doula you know what that  you know what  doula  thats  white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy  keyser s\\u00f6ze all  pain away  lot  women tried  freak me out they tried  freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on  table i was like yeah i look forward  it im all backed up from holding  my shit at work i cant wait  cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre  labor you push you push you push  your husband will be asked  assist   labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into  soft serve lever you just shit on  floor  front   love  your life  just when you think thats enough  make him finally leave you boom  baby comes out  he gotta stay thats  real miracle  life right there i can already see how  child can really take its toll on  marriage because  baby hasnt even come out yet  i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me  do shit around  house hey can you wash  dishes no can you water  plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin  eyeball ok are you makin  foot i didnt think so you change  channeli can already see how theres like this crazy double standard  our society  how it takes so little  be considered  great dad  it also takes so little  be considered  shitty mom people praise my husband for coming  all  my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes  all your doctors appointments he  so supportive guess who else has  go  those doctor appointments me im  star   show theres nothing for  camera  see if im not there but hes  hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im  bad mommyyou know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like  daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out  survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have  chip away at his selfesteem on  daily basis  keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy  another womans affection  leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge  dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that  baby can see like  bullseye so that  baby can find it easier  then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now  naked i look like  minion but im not gonna be one  those crazy pregnant ladies who tries  get all back  shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me   year i will have  kind  body where if i do  nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing itnow that im seven   half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know  i was like why  it different  i looked it up  my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus  protect  baby from bacteria attacking it thats not  same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporinso you know i\\u2013 i \\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated  bunch  losers  then i meet this dream guy whos like way more handsome than me out  my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard  trap his ass got him  propose  me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true  then we got pregnant  recently we bought our first home together  uh two weeks into  escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was   debt  me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes  one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went  harvard business school  epicenter  whitecollar crime he enrond my ass  now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven   half months pregnantall right ive been ali wong have  good night everybody\"\n        ],\n
