        "Another popular text analysis technique is called topic modeling. The ultimate goal of topic modeling is to find various topics that are present in your corpus. Each document in the corpus will be made up of at least one topic, if not multiple topics.\n",

        "Once the topic modeling technique is applied, your job as a human is to interpret the results and see if the mix of words in each topic make sense. If they don't make sense, you can try changing up the number of topics, the terms in the document-term matrix, model parameters, or even try a different model."

technically highrisk but my body was starting  show signs  change  it\\u2013  it scared me like im only   my pussy  not as wet as it used  be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old  your pussy was just sopping wet all  time all  time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up  peace sign afterwards  there would be that snailtrail  between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow  bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbustersi dont know what kind  mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im   i did have  get  little bit  science involved when trying  get pregnant   lot  that  most likely my fault because when i was  my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like  smokers lung  i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had  take these hormone pills that were suppositories  push pop them up myself every single night  then at my writing job at fresh off  boat i would be storyboarding  front  my coworkers  then at some point  pill would inevitably dissolve  melt into my underwear  i had  act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok  then  side effect   progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had  find ways  discretely scratch myself underneath  conference table  then resist  urge  immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want  be able  smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch  sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make  sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about  when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find  way  smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious  protect you cause you gotta check that its all good   hood if its too funky you need  see  doctor your fingers are your first webmdwhen my husband  i were trying  have  kid  lot  people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin  lot  fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do  your  ok when \\u2013 when youre  your   youve been trying  get pregnant for  while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when  eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time  i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out   month  outside  that i would be like were not fuckin i need you  save it i want your sperm  be as pentup  as angry  rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release  kraken  they just come out like  bunch  angry refugees escaping  dictatorship you know  um yeah  most   time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home  see  smiley face on  ovulation strip  id be like ok its go time  i would just give my husband  hand job most   time  he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre  such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need  close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying  shut  image  your face out  their head  instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto  back  their eyelids which  fine by me because then he doesnt have  see  expression on my face that says please hurry  fuck up  then when he was about  finish i could always tell because  indication  very universal when  man  about  finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by  zombie just  then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me   eye  remember  come with intention ok  then i would jump on him  hold onto his neck  i would just twerk twerk twerk  shit out  him  do some  this shit that i learned  atlanta  then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards  make sure all  that harvard nectar would just drain inside  me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymoreim very grateful  be pregnant   be this far along  be seven   half months pregnant because last year i had  miscarriage which  very common   lot  women who are  their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark  terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty  women who have had  miscarriage its super common  i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from  third world country  when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing  pair  shoes its whatevs ok  everything happens for  reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which  very early   doctor says  me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins  i was like no  then she said but what i dont see   heartbeat  i was like yes  lord  mysterious dont feel bad ok they were  size  poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than  twins that i lost  most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through  miscarriage i sat my husband down  front  me while i sat on  toilet  i was like you look you watch  whole thing  he felt so bad for me  i used it as leverage  held that shit over his head for  month  got him  do whatever  fuck i wanted him  do for  days he took me  see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me  bike off  craigslist thats my miscarriage bike  i love it very much for  days i finally had  marriage i always wantedim scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared  childbirth thats why im going  hire  doula you know what that  you know what  doula  thats  white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy  keyser s\\u00f6ze all  pain away  lot  women tried  freak me out they tried  freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on  table i was like yeah i look forward  it im all backed up from holding  my shit at work i cant wait  cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre  labor you push you push you push  your husband will be asked  assist   labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into  soft serve lever you just shit on  floor  front   love  your life  just when you think thats enough  make him finally leave you boom  baby comes out  he gotta stay thats  real miracle  life right there i can already see how  child can really take its toll on  marriage because  baby hasnt even come out yet  i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me  do shit around  house hey can you wash  dishes no can you water  plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin  eyeball ok are you makin  foot i didnt think so you change  channeli can already see how theres like this crazy double standard  our society  how it takes so little  be considered  great dad  it also takes so little  be considered  shitty mom people praise my husband for coming  all  my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes  all your doctors appointments he  so supportive guess who else has  go  those doctor appointments me im  star   show theres nothing for  camera  see if im not there but hes  hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im  bad mommyyou know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like  daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out  survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have  chip away at his selfesteem on  daily basis  keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy  another womans affection  leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge  dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that  baby can see like  bullseye so that  baby can find it easier  then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now  naked i look like  minion

real woman i hit them with  oldfashioned stereotype she must be  bad driver then right  target   joke   celebrity killing someone  their car lets not forget that shall we  celebrity killing someone  their car running home  popping on  dress thats  target   joke just so were clear okay she was interviewed  week later at \\u00a0press conference for  show  hers now cancelled  one   press said what

her host just dont let her drive another website that was   room entertainment weekly they tweeted  different headline  they ed me  their headline was caitlyn finally breaks silence over ricky gervais i just sent back at last she always brakes too late bring it on bring it on but im  considered comedian i like my jokes  be accurate  my targets  be fair so i was engaging these people saying why  it transphobic they said its about  trans person thats ridiculous thats like saying  joke about bill cosby  automatically racist it depends on  joke but im willing  learn i found out my crime was that i deadnamed her id never heard that term before  day after  golden globes  that was saying her old name  even acknowledging she used  be  man but she did i saw him on  olympic games he was  decathlete\\u00a0he was  everything all over  place shot put  pole vault he won  medal he was famous he was on telly all  time you know  big famous man with  huge i dont know im guessing probably he was big but ive learnt my lesson now i know its wrong id never deadname her now but years ago when she was  man years ago im saying  she went   doctor  knocked on  door  doctor went come  this  years ago id never deadname her now but this  like  flashback before anyone you know what so so like come   he went hello bruce jenner because that that was his name then  doctor\\u2013 this was years ago

chimp so i can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep  same girlfriend jane would be happy she loves me she loves chimps so you know i reckon thats got  be easier for  man  turn into  chimp were so close than for  man  turn\\u00a0into  woman  many ways  bit  hair   top lip like that as opposed  your cock  balls ripped off   hole gouged out into\\u2013 im not  doctor but that   gist  it i know which one id rather have done im not saying chimps are better than women no way right any ladies here i cant see you but  me every single one  you  equal   chimp so so id have all that done hair  that id do all that all  ill retain  ability  speak english like  emergencies im talking  jane shes going what  it what  it bobo you left  fucking oven on theres  fire are you saying that if caitlyn jenner was being chased by  wolf  there was  big fence but she had  long pole shed revert shed be over that fucking easy so id have all that done top lip doing all that right ill be legally  chimp ill

all  love maybe matching jumpers come on bobo  love just two like that then if  bigot   van slows down  goes thats fucking disgusting ill fling shit at him  run up  tree  thats why that joke isnt transphobic so cheersso humanity what  humanity what are we well weve touched upon it there were great apes not metaphorically were literally great apes we are  genetically identical   chimpanzee were closer  chimps than chimps are  gorillas we left our common ancestor about six million years ago we have  same life cycle same as any other animal which  our parents mate were born we grow we mate our

like alopecia but he was bald for ten years into his thirties turns up one day at our house elvis what \\u2013 i was about eight i said  auntie edna what happened she went it was  miracle they were lying they were just everyone knew he was bald but hed embroiled his family   lie so they had  lie as well theyre going yeah it just grew back theres so much he wouldnt do cause he was terrified   wig

room weve got photos   family album if hes at  wedding or  christening  hes holding  baby its always at arms length like that so it cant grab his wig it must have been on his mind all  time right it was  only thing he feared  wig coming off  public  this ridiculous lie being exposed he was   army hard as nails he wasnt scared  anyone or anything spiders snakes cancer hows  chemo going uncle not  problem weve got  photo  him  last year i think he was  it must have been  last year he was alive it was  hot day he was   garden  his little trunks he was  wizened little man by then white chest hair jet black wig still died  it buried  it hes wearing it now  little skeleton with jet black hair like posh spice for eternitybut i knew that was gonna happen i knew i would get old  fat  ill  blind  deaf  shit myself  be pushed round   fucking bucket youre ready because youre warned you know about getting old what they dont talk about so youre not prepared  it was  shock  me i only found out recently ill share it with you now  distending testicles see you dont know about it but it happens  your fifties i wasnt checking them or anything i didnt see em for  years as  young man they were pert  now theyre like two plums   sock i dont know when it happened but it was recently they just  this  how i found out so as ive been getting older  theyve been secretly stretching away as ive got older ive got richer so my baths have been getting more luxurious last year i moved into  new house  hampstead big bath big sunken bath southfacing windows i was  there  first night lovely bath sun streaming  classical music this   life i looked down  theyre floating right now id never dreamt that testicles would float they seem like theyd be heavy you could tie things down with them  theyd sink you know most people never see their   sea youre  trunks   shower they dangle  baths arent usually that deep that was my first thought oh my god i never thought testicles would float then my second thought kicked  hold on this baths two feet deep right im sitting on  bottom theyre on top whats going on right  i looked  my testicles are now longer than my penis easily by some way right  fact theyd created  little fleshy sort  life raft right my penis was dry just nestled just floating on top like that like that just bouncing around i should have given it  little whistle im just thinking this  bizarre fucking hell right  i thought maybe its  fluke so i held them under  water for  minute i let them go  they bobbed up theyre really theyre really buoyant right try it when you get home if youre  your    man obviously or caitlyn jennerbut but  world  getting worse  i blame  beginning  its demise on social media because twitter  facebook thats where this ridiculous notion bred  became stable that it was more important  be popular than right everything was like me agree with me it falls into two tribes i dont agree with them so i block them  now  this posttruth era people dont care about  argument they say whos saying  argument no theyre not on our side its ludicrous okay  it also bred this ridiculous notion weve always had my opinion  worth as much as yours now its my opinion  worth as much as your fact which  nonsense i get tweets from people saying i believe  earth   years old i believe youre  fucking idiot you cant have an opinion on  age   earth you can have opinions but not your own facts but it was all about being popular right  even politicians picked up those symptoms politicians tweet now they want  be popular we had  brexit referendum cause they passed  buck they didnt want  make  mistake  theres  ridiculous thing  lets ask  average person what they think lets stop asking  average person what they do you know how fucking stupid  average person  we still sell bottles  bleach with big labels on that say do not drink right lets take those labels off right for two years  then have  referendum but its not just politicians even real news  news on tv says things like tweet us your news dont let them tweet you  news i saw  tyrannosaurus rex you liar right there was  big news story last year about  train crash that happened  year before  there was an inquiry  results   inquiry were published  there was an expert on  news he said weve looked at everything  weve decided that  speed   trains was  contributing factor so were going  slow them down  bit statistically this shouldnt happen again that would have been it but  guy went we asked  public what they thought then there was three banal vox pops first one said i already pay \\u00a3  year so im not happy  next one said it takes me  minutes each way its not good enough  last one said i say its better  arrive at work late than dead why  that on  news  when  that applicable  any situation all right ted youre  early ted oh ted weve been through this remember i said id rather you arrive late than deadbut  big enemy  stupidity right i wanna share with you  most stupid tweet i ever got now admittedly when i first got on twitter i pushed my agenda i was an outspoken atheist not  change anyones opinions i thought it was important  tell  other side there are still  countries where people are put  death for being an atheist i just wanted  say its fine  be an atheist its fine  believe  god  its fine not  thats all i was saying i realized i didnt have  tweet about religion or atheism i could tweet  fact  that annoyed just  right people id tweet things like happy birthday earth four point six billion years old today someone would always go we know what youre fucking doing this   tweet i got\\u00a0after one  those  it was all  capitals which excited me thats  sign  twitter madness mixed with anger its great right i looked at his profile sure enough hes  gentleman from texas hes  fundamentalist creationist christian which  fine he loves god he loves god  fetuses mainly he loves  fetus from conception  when it turns out gay  then hes remember its  capitals hes shouting at me best tweet ever your science\\u2013 my science right science by  way  spelled scients already good isnt it i mean hes obviously heard  word he took  guess never seen it written down because its not   bible so hes your scients wont help you well it will its helping him beam this little message up   satellite  down  me your scients wont help you when satan  course he believes  satan why not he believes that god made  universe  six days youre not gonna say  him do you believe  satan  have him say bit farfetched why doesnt god kill satan thats what id ask him if i was wrong  i met god id go oh you do exist hed go yeah id go ive got  few fucking questions mate  first one would be why did you make chocolate kill dogs mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why did you put  male gspot up  arse what what  wrong with you then id say why dont you kill satan  hed go what id go why dont you kill satan if he does all  bad stuff  you do\\u00a0all  good stuff which you want i mean you do want\\u2013 yes yeah you could kill him if you wanted you can do anything easy yeah why dont you kill him then because shut up your scients wont help you when satan  raping your british ass  hes got  point because if i die  i find myself  hell being raped by satan science has pretty much let me down but its this last line that he just throws away  line he signs off with makes this  best tweet ive ever received your scients wont help you when satan  raping your british ass ill be laughing so hes there too hes so hes  fundamentalist christian whos lived his life by  old  new testaments he dies he wakes up  hell right which must be off  charts on  scale  emotional trauma oh my god im  hell oh my god why have you forsaken me im gonna be tortured for eternity he sees me getting raped  goes ha ha ha hes suddenly over it  he his days suddenly got  little bit brighter  like hes not next right so im getting raped right by  devil right hes just there you fucking atheist scum  im like

saying it was dark he wore  ski mask  he was giggling thats never so i sent back you mean jokes about rape she said yes i went depends on  joke it fucking doesnt im going no it does it does it depends on  joke its about context\\u00a0its about content what do you mean by  rape joke she said even  joke with  word rape  it  unacceptable i said thats ridiculous it depends what  joke  i tweeted that clip  me   office going i think theres been  rape up there everyone gets that because   context   target   middleaged man whos so narcissistic hell say anything  win  silly game you have  understand  joke  where it comes from i said\\u00a0some jokes dont punch up or down they dont punch anywhere they can just be  pun  play\\u00a0on words that dont really mean anything  joke went round when i was

what why  lady says she wont laugh if youre  off you gothats what  world  like people take everything personally they think  world revolves around them particularly on twitter im not tweeting anyone im just tweeting i dont know whos following me ive got  million followers they can be following me without me knowing choose  read my tweet  then take that personally thats like going into  town square seeing  big noticeboard saying guitar lessons  you go but i dont fucking want guitar lessons whats this theres  number here right call that are you giving guitar lessons i dont fucking want any fine its not for you then just walk away dont worry about iti should say one thing  twitters defense i use it as  marketing tool  for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for me personally im very into anti animal cruelty years ago it would take ages  get  signatures on  petition standing outside tescos or something thats  magic number because then it gets heard  parliament ive been part  many campaigns through twitter when weve got  signatures  days   law has been changed thank you  those whove retweeted about animal cruelty it makes  difference thank you but even something as clear  distinct as animal cruelty you think no ones gonna argue with that yes they will they just wanna be heard ill tweet something about  bull being tortured   bullring for entertainment i say ban bullfighting someone always says what about  kids  syria what well im not giving you  choice you can do both im not saying throw that kid back   hole theres  bull hereand theres one thing that i didnt want  my head but it exists so we have  deal with it now that i found out through twitter theres  thing called  yulin dog meat festival  china every year  its horrendous  we send people with money  buy  dogs  bring them back its  drop   ocean they eat thousands over this weekend i tweet  details  petition people dont really read it its  kneejerk people say racist i go what they go we eat pigs  cows   west yep we do i dont but yeah i used  youre right  pig or  cow  worth as much as  dog its not about  species its what they do  these poor dogs what they do  torture  dogs first cause they think it makes  meat taste better they beat them they blowtorch them they even skin them alive  i saw this picture on twitter   opening  this ceremony these two guys  this chinese square  theyre skinning this dog alive its screaming theyre laughing its  worst thing ive ever seen i thought ive got  tweet that i tweeted  picture with  petition  i just said one beautiful creature  two ugly cunts skinning it alive right  it took off loads  retweets it made  press i got one tweet back from  woman that said  that language necessary i should have left it right but i was i was incensed i said youre more offended by  word than by an animal being tortured  death she said i just hate  cword i definitely should have left it i sent back people who hate  cword would hear it  lot less if they didnt go round acting like such cunts thank you youve been fantastic good night cheers thank you so much thank you so muchi hope you enjoyed  show i hope noone was offended no i really do thats not  point ive always wanted people  know they can laugh at bad things without being bad people i think its my upbringing i grew up  poverty with nothing but  point was  pay your way then have  laugh that was  men  women carried on working it was my older brother bob it was him who i first saw making these dark jokes right   bad situation as things were happening people were laughing i realized hes healing them thats what comedys for what humors for it gets us over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spent an hour   pound shop  hayling island just asking  cashier how much everything was just  see if he could break this poor mans will bob was  first person i saw answer back  authority  first authority you come across are your parents  hed get  trouble he got sent  bed but i thought hed won  argument  hed tease my mum my mum was  typical workingclass woman as i say we lived   shitty area right  most   houses looked like  bit  mud   stolen bike  fence posts missing she mended  fence turfed  garden herself painted  step she thought if it looked\\u00a0respectable wed be respectable it was about reputation i guess bob would send her postcards that just read  that pedophile postman still reading your mail  shed take it shed go   shed be horrified shed call bob he saw it this time you must stop doing that even at her funeral my mum died first  my dad carried on for  year or so just drinking beer then he went at mums funeral we had different duties i did catering  flowers bob went  see  local vicar that was  mistake right wed never been  church he didnt know us we didnt know him so he said  bob tell me about your mum so i can say  few words bob saw that as an opportunity right so bob with  straight face said well she was  keen racist  vicar went i cant say that bob said okay put she liked gardening he was trying  get\\u00a0 vicar  say something  make us laugh  church he didnt warn us  he did get something by  vicar so were called ricky robert\\u2013 bob\\u2013 ricky robert marsha  larry now larry   oldest  his seventies born   war i always thought he was  sensible one first born weight   world on his shoulders my mum said when he was  teenager he got  job  gave her  money  help out hes  standup guy larry so bob gives  vicar  wrong name didnt warn us were all  church start   funeral were all there packed out  coffin comes down

larry eventually started doing this   vicars thinking what have i said right hed put   few things  vicar didnt know that set us off again things that were just lies or slightly wrong my nieces  nephews started crying id come prepared with  pack  tissues theyd take one  hand it on before  funeral id taken  tissues out written on them folded them back  put them   each tissue said snivelling

ended  funeral  he made  beeline for me  bob he said sorry was that okay me  bob went\\u00a0fucking brilliant\\u00a0mate it was fucking brilliant thats what i mean were all\\u00a0gonna die so we should have  laugh if you can laugh   face  adversity youre bulletproof me  my brother bob had one simple rule  that was if you think  something funny youve got  say it win lose or draw it might go well it might go badly but youve gotta say it  bear that  mind as i leave you with this right so were all   car one day bobs driving packed  this car  little day trip   beach we get stopped for

at her as they smoked  her face these were real doctors they were like i dont know shes rude ill tell you that i mean i think what i saw growing up i mean we would go watch my dads  magician so we would go watch my dad do magic at  wilson county fair county fairs are great if you never theyre still going around i dont think  government knows about them but i mean we ride these rides that were on  interstate an hour ago so we would go watch my dad so my dad would do magic right next  him they had  donkey jumping off  high dive into  pool so pretty hard  keep everybodys attention when my dad  like  this your card  everybodys like this donkeys about  jump off this high dive thats something you dont think you wanna see till its up there  i use  word jump very loosely these donkeys are falling off this high dive but you cant put that on  sign you know you gonna watch  donkey fall off  high dive no okay what if he jumped well at least hes into itso  donkey would go up this ramp like  feet   air  it would just stand there cause it doesnt want  jump its not  on this so but it gets stuck cause donkeys cant walk backwards not positive if that  true but i ive never seen  donkey go backwards ive never even really looked but i honestly think  years i would have seen  couple donkeys go backwards so  donkey stands there   dog he sends  dog up  ramp it barks at  donkey   donkey jumps   pool  as someone that has seen this i tell you when that donkey hits  water youre like we should probably get out  here uh its not as fun as you thought it would be i mean this  going  sound dumb but youre really surprised youre seeing what  sign said you would see peta got  hold  that they shut it down  that was one i think everybody was like fair enough we get that another one peta had  shut down this was again like   i was alive you could fight an orangutan at  fair they would have an orangutan just sitting   boxing ring  guys would pay  fight it  i say guys because i just cant imagine one woman ever fought this orangutan i think you can put an orangutan   room with  thousand women  when they walked out like did anybody fight it it never crossed our mind  fight itput three men  that room two  those men will fight that orangutan  other one wouldve started it going i think yall should fight that orangutan so guys get  there  theyre like all right well go fight this orangutan   orangutan would just knock everybody out because we dont have  internet  look up how strong  an orangutan its all wordofmouth back then you had  meet  guy that just fought an orangutan youre like but  arms are skinny hes like i know thats what made me get  there as wellso peta put  stop  that also yeah look whatever you want  say about peta they did some real work    theres  first one   first things they had  do car manufacturers before crash test dummies were invented they would use  pig   car wreck so they sit  pig i guess upright  this little pig pigs are smart pretty good day for this pig its like you gonna let me drive  car pretty fun pretty fun day hes got his elbow out are yall kidding me right now you gonna let me drive this car i dont even know what that shows you pigs dont have necks thats what i was around when i was growing up i mean i look at my daughter  i have more  common with  pilgrim  pilgrims believed  witches little side note i would like  say i think  witch phase was  toughest phase for women  have  go through not  get serious but  lot  people say voting i disagree i think its witch then voting i think its witch pretty big gap then you know

trying  get  witch joke  its pretty complicated theres  lot  moving parts you got  bring up pilgrims somehow i took  typing class  seventh grade thats howand i thought it was  waste  my time i  my head i was like whos going  be typing cursive   futurethats why i cause  future i dont know whats going i dont know technology i dont know what ai  i dont think you get  know what ai   also see  donkey jump off  high dive i think it was one or  other  i saw  donkey so im out if i send an email  it says  file  too big i dont know what  do my best guess  i try  resend it thats what i try  you
